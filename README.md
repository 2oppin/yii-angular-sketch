yii-angular-sketch
==================

Played around with anugularjs tutorial, so tryed to put it in Yii project as a module, maybe it would be useful for someone, will try to update it sometime :^)

This is a scetch. Project built with apache2 and initially was need for several yii-based projects, so it have htaccess that redirects subdomains to accordind folders.

In that a case : [phonegap].yourdomain.root 

So in virtual hosts config file you should set your DocumentRoot to the root file if you want to use folders as subdomains, 
or set phoneshop/html if you want to use single project.
